        <h2>Steps</h2>
        When you’re putting your skis on, set the skis pointing in the same direction about 1 foot apart. If you're out in the <br> snow wipe off any snow from the bindings in the middle of the skis and off the bottoms of your boots. Then, one <br> foot   at a time, push the toe of your boot into the front binding. Press your heel down until you hear it click into the rear binding and you have got one of the shoes successfully on! <br> <br> If it doesn't work, your shoes may not be the right size or there may be snow inside the bindings so ask someone nearby for help.
    <br> <br>
    When you're at the top of a little hill, stand with your knees bent and a slight lean forward. Stand so your skis are about hip-width apart then bend your knees so your shins rest on the front of the boots and you’re leaning slightly forward to balance your weight. Keeping your back straight and look forward to maintain the correct ski stance and posture is important, and be confident.
    Keep trying over and over again as it continues to get better, if need get lessons which is the most efficient way to learn fast. <br>
    Then you can learn how to do tricks but don't always take risks.

        <h2>Getting back up the mountain</h2>
        Getting back up the mountain usually depends on which hill you are on, if on a smaller hill there is usually a conveyor belt, there will be people who can help you. When you are getting on it make sure you put weight on the front of your body, tilting forward, then you can relax a little. At the top make sure not to keep tilting too forward sicne you will be sliding off.
<br> <br> If you are on the higher mountains, there is a ski lift. If you have someone experienced with you it is much easier, if on your own you can ask someone. The people will signal you when to go, there will be a line and you have to stand infront of it. The seat will come behind you, once its near you quickly sit on it and pull the bar down.

        <h2>How to Stop</h2> The Snowplough method
                  <br>    <img src="skiing.jpg">  
     The snowplough method is usually one of the easiest methods and most common ones taught to begginers.
     Make sure to start by practising on flat ground and getting used to the feeling of being in a snowplough position. Point your toes towards each other and push your feet apart to rotate your skis into a wedge-shaped position and it should be like a pizza. Make sure that your body is in a balanced position with your shoulders forward so it is more efficent.
