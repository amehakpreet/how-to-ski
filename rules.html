        <h2>Common Sense</h2>
        Always stay in control and be able to stop or avoid other people or objects.
        <br>
        People ahead of you have the right of way. It’s your responsibility to avoid them.
        <br>
        Don’t stop where you obstruct a trail or aren’t visible from above.
        <br>
        Whenever starting downhill or merging into a trail, look uphill and yield to others.
        <br>
        Always use devices to help prevent runaway equipment.
        <br>
        Observe all posted signs and warnings. Keep off closed trails and out of closed areas.
        <br>
        Prior to using any lift, you must have the knowledge and ability to load, ride, and unload safely.
